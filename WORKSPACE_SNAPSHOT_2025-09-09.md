Workspace snapshot — 2025-09-09

Summary:
- Repo path: Projekt Obciążenie nowa wersja/
- Main app: `app/main.py` (FastAPI)
- Runner: `run_uvicorn.py`
- Data files (expected at repo root): `DostepnoscWTygodniach.xlsx`, `Raport_dane.xlsx`
- Recent edits applied:
  - Removed duplicate/stray code in `app/main.py`.
  - Implemented a single defensive `/device_parts/{device_id}` endpoint that:
    - Detects columns heuristically in `RaportProdukcja`.
    - Filters by group and returns per-part `DevicePartLoad` records for selected months.
    - Writes traceback to `device_parts_error.log` on unexpected exceptions.
  - UI changes (embedded in `app/main.py` HTML): removed year 2024 from month dropdown and made month checkboxes inline.

Current status:
- Server: Not running (no listener on port 8001 at snapshot time).
- Backend `/devices` and `/availability` endpoints respond correctly in earlier tests.
- `/device_parts/{device_id}` was implemented but in some runs returned empty results in the UI; standalone Excel inspections confirm production data exists and heuristics detect required columns. Root cause likely a mismatch between group text used in availability data and group values in production sheet (exact match vs contains). I added defensive logging to help capture runtime exceptions.

Next steps (recommended):
1. Start the server and call `/device_parts/{device_id}?month=YYYY-MM` to capture runtime behavior and the `device_parts_error.log` if any error occurs.
2. If endpoint returns empty list, update matching logic to try `contains` fallback (group substring) — low risk and likely to reveal parts such as `10250_Frezarki`.
3. Improve frontend to show an inline expandable parts table and display a friendly message when no parts are found rather than an alert.

Files edited during today's session:
- `app/main.py` — cleaned imports, deduplicated endpoints, added defensive `/device_parts` and logging.

Notes:
- I stopped the server and ensured port 8001 is free before saving this snapshot.
- If you want, tomorrow I can finish the contains-fallback change and verify end-to-end UI behavior.

Status: paused — ready to continue next session.
